Pode indicar que nos encontramos num ponto da nossa vida em que estamos prontos para embarcar numa nova etapa e descobrir novas aventuras. Se sua questão é a respeito de amor, o Louco pode indicar a chegada de um novo amor ou a necessidade de ter maior liberdade. Pode, também, indicar que a pessoa ainda não sabe bem aquilo que quer. Esta é uma fase de descoberta, em que deve deixar os sentimentos fluírem sem querer impor-lhes uma ordem fixa. Se sua questão é a respeito de saúde esta carta pode indicar instabilidade, pode também alertar para a necessidade de ser mais cuidadoso com a sua saúde. Pode ser um alerta para os excessos ou para uma atitude negligente. Se sua questão é a respeito de trabalho indica uma possível viagem, um novo trabalho, uma nova etapa, ou alerta para a necessidade de abraçar novos desafios e experimentar domínios onde antes não arriscou aventurar-se.
